        <h5 class="card-title">Smart Irrigation</h5>
        <p class="card-text">In the United States, outdoor water use alone averages more than 9 billion gallons of water each day, mainly for landscape irrigation. As much as 50% of this water is wasted due to overwatering caused by inefficiencies in traditional irrigation methods and systems. Smart irrigation technology is the answer.

          Smart irrigation systems tailor watering schedules and run times automatically to meet specific landscape needs. These controllers significantly improve outdoor water use efficiencies.
          
          Unlike traditional irrigation controllers that operate on a preset programmed schedule and timers, smart irrigation controllers monitor weather, soil conditions, evaporation and plant water use to automatically adjust the watering schedule to actual conditions of the site.
          
          For example, as outdoor temperatures increase or rainfall decreases, smart irrigation controllers consider on site-specific variables, such as soil type, sprinklers’ application rate, etc. to adjust the watering run times or schedules. There are several options for smart irrigation controllers.</p>

        <h5 class="card-title">Remote Sensing</h5>
        <p class="card-text">Remote sensing is the process of detecting and monitoring the physical characteristics of an area by measuring its reflected and emitted radiation at a distance (typically from satellite or aircraft). Special cameras collect remotely sensed images, which help researchers "sense" things about the Earth. Some examples are:
          Cameras on satellites and airplanes take images of large areas on the Earth's surface, allowing us to see much more than we can see when standing on the ground.
          Sonar systems on ships can be used to create images of the ocean floor without needing to travel to the bottom of the ocean.
          Cameras on satellites can be used to make images of temperature changes in the oceans.

        <h5 class="card-title">What Is 5G NR? Understanding the New Radio Standard</h5>
        <p class="card-text">Large-scale, commercial 5G networks are beginning to achieve useable coverage. Major telecom players have been making serious strides with deployments due to Dynamic Spectrum Sharing (DSS). DSS allows a connected device to use a single frequency band in 4G LTE and 5G through an allocation scheme based on the device’s needs and available RAT resources. 

          DSS has allowed operators to provide 5G service while upgrading their RANs. Operators can calibrate spectrum resource allocation more in sync with user demand for 5G.
          
          Despite initial reliance on LTE architecture, 5G NR is not backward-compatible and represents a leap forward for cellular technology.
          
          The push for LTE network enhancements connected 15 billion IoT devices in 2015. It began delivering gigabit speeds in some limited applications in 2018. Because of these advances, 5G NR has already started to provide eMBB and URLLC services from non-stand-alone networks.
          
          However, to come alive, 5G’s revolutionary service enablement power needs stand-alone (SA) 5G networks.
          
          In April 2019, China Telecom, State Grid and Huawei announced that the group of companies concluded the first successful live power slice test based on a 5G SA network. Within days, China Mobile also announced a first-of-kind live 5G SA network test with Huawei and Baidu.</p>
